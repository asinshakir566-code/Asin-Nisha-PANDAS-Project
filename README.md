📘 Overview :

This Project cleans and organizes raw data by fixing errors, removing duplicates,handling missing values, and standardizing formats to create a reliable dataset ready for analysis.

🎯 Objective :

To transform messy and inconsistent raw data into a clean, accurate,and well-structured dataset suitable for analysis and reporting.

🧠 Key Steps Involved :
Importing and inspecting raw data, Handling Missing Values,Correcting data types and formats,removing duplicates and errors, detecting and addressing outliers,Validating final results and exporting the cleaned dataset.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies :

Python 🐍 Pandas NumPy OpenPyXL Excel / CSV for dataset handling Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for running scripts.

📂 Dataset :

File Name: mega_data_cleaning_dataset.xlsx Description: The dataset is a multi-sheet Excel file containing raw business/customer-related information with irregular formatting, missing entries, duplicate records, and inconsistent data values, making it an ideal resource for applying advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

🚀 Expected Outcomes :

Expected Outcomes: A fully cleaned and organized dataset corrected data types and standardized formats removed duplicates and resolved missing values a final file ready for accurate analysis and reporting.

💡 Future Enhancements : Future Enhancements: Automate the cleaning scripts, add validation rules for continuous quality checks, expand the dataset for deeper analysis.
